# ng2-firebase Demo
A Demo Application for [ng2-firebase](https://github.com/KallynGowdy/ng2-firebase)

This repository is split into two parts, a TypeScript implementation, and an ES5 implementation.

- `ts`, The folder that contains the TypeScript application.
- `js`, The folder that contains the JavaScript ES5 application.

Both of these applications follow the [Angular 2 Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/).
